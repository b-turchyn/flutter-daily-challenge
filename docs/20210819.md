## Implementation Notes

These sliver cards were based on the card style that I saw over on [Dribbble](https://r.btdev.org/1I).

[MEX - Android Flutter Design system](https://r.btdev.org/1J)

I wanted to try this mainly to see how to use the [`ClipPath`](https://r.btdev.org/1K)
widget to apply custom shapes to containers. Rounded corners are easily doable with the `decoration`
property on the Container, but I wanted to try something more difficult.

`ClipPath` gives you access to the size of the container the clipping is being applied to, and so
you can use that to provide relatively-sized paths. In my case I left the rounded corner sizes fixed
because that wasn't important, but could have scaled it appropriately if I wanted to.

The pathing is all done with a [`Path`](https://r.btdev.org/1L)
object.

A few points for implementation are below.

### Arcs are done with radians

While I don't know the reason why radians are used over degrees (probably because I dropped out of
my Computer Graphics course in university), but they are. Given that I don't have the mental
fortitude to remember my radian math, I used the following helper method to convert degrees to
radians and let the computer do the heavy lifting:
```dart
import 'dart:math' as Math;

// ...

num degToRad(num deg) => deg * (Math.pi / 180.0);
```

My final design didn't need this calculation, but my first attempt did and it saved me a lot of
headaches. 

### `relativeArcToPoint` is a great helper method

I was originally trying to use `arcTo` and `drawArc` to draw the rounded corners, but I found it
much easier to use `relativeArcToPoint` for a few reasons:

* In my case, it was easier to do relative offsets to correctly position the end of the arc.
* `arcTo` and `drawArc` both care about the starting position and the number of radians you want to
  draw your arc. `relativeArcToPoint` you just specify the radius and the offset of the ending point
  and let the drawer do its thing. This is great for my scenario, but clearly the other two are much
  more powerful.

### CustomClipper sizing includes the container's margins

The total size your
[`CustomClipper`](https://r.btdev.org/1N) is presented with includes your margin size, and so if
you're starting at `[0, 0]` with your clip, that point is actually behind the margin, and this might
not be what you want. In my case, it made finding the corners _much_ harder and so simply not
applying the margins to the container I was clipping really simplified things.

### Text widgets will always expand; contain them with Align

This caused some frustration when getting the "REDEEM" text correctly positioned.
