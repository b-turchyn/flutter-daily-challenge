# Flutter Daily Challenges

A random dumping ground of ideas that I try out in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).
I need a place to try things, and this is it.

## Running

* Clone the repo
* Run `pub get`
* Open in your preferred Flutter IDE and run

## Build Diaries

Any sort of documentation and reading about a particular day is probably not in the app itself, but
in the `doc/` directory. The filename of the challenge day corresponds to the filename of the
documentation, so it should be pretty easy to find.
